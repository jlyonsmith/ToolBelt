ToolBelt Utility Library

Every programmer has one!  This is mine.  At the last look it contains classes and tools for:

- String resource wrapper generation (Buckle.exe)
- Collection helpers
- Running "commands" i.e. command prompt stuff, and collecting the output
- Console output with error, warning, "normal" formatting
- Automatic command line parsing using attributed classes
- Console utility stuff
- Directory/file searching
- Endian binary readers/writers
- Memory buffer management
- Creating "task" classes including those for MSBuild
- File/directory parsing using the ParsedPath class
- Parsed path "lists", e.g. the PATH environment variable
- String utilities, including word wrapping text
- Process cycle stop watch

Enjoy!
